08/03/2025, 14:01 - +91 93906 78835: Summary of the First Meeting on Research Paper Preparation

Today, in our first meeting, we had an engaging and interactive session where Abul provided an introduction to research and review papers. He explained their fundamental differences, their importance in academia, and how to structure them effectively. We also explored the role of AI tools in assisting with research paper preparation.

Key Learnings from the Session

1. Understanding Research and Review Papers

A research paper presents original findings, experiments, or theories based on in-depth analysis.

A review paper summarizes and evaluates existing research in a specific field, providing insights into trends, gaps, and advancements.



2. Using AI Tools for Research Paper Writing

Google Scholar: A search engine for finding scholarly articles, research papers, and citations.

Hypernotes: A tool for organizing research ideas, creating structured notes, and linking concepts efficiently.

Paperpal: An AI-powered assistant for improving academic writing by suggesting edits for clarity, grammar, and coherence.

Ink Scape: A vector graphics editor useful for creating high-quality diagrams, charts, and illustrations for research papers.

Visio: A diagramming tool that helps visualize complex ideas, processes, and research methodologies.

Mendeley: A reference manager and academic social network that assists in organizing and citing research papers.



3. Process for Appointed Person and Video

Before 7:00 PM, Abul will send a video link to the appointed person, and everyone should watch the video.

The appointed person is responsible for watching the video and then appointing another person the next day.

This cycle should continue, ensuring that more people get introduced to research paper writing systematically.

20/03/2025, 13:30 - +91 93639 00355: Procedure to Write a Research Paper

Writing a research paper requires careful planning and execution. The first step is to consult your professor or research guide to discuss your area of interest. This helps in narrowing down a relevant topic and gaining insights into the research gaps that need to be addressed. Professors can also recommend useful research papers, journals, and methodologies that can guide your study.

Once the topic is decided, the next step is to conduct a thorough literature review. This involves reading and analyzing existing research papers from reputed sources like IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, and Springer. Reviewing previous studies helps in understanding the current advancements, identifying limitations, and framing a unique research problem. Taking detailed notes and summarizing key findings is essential for building a strong foundation for your research.

After analyzing existing work, the research problem and objectives must be clearly defined. A well-structured research question ensures that the study remains focused and contributes meaningfully to the field. Based on this, the methodology is designed, which may include experiments, data collection, surveys, or model development. Once the data is gathered, it needs to be analyzed using appropriate statistical or computational techniques to derive meaningful results.

With the research findings in hand, the next step is writing the paper. A standard research paper includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and references. The introduction should present the problem statement and significance, while the literature review provides context. The methodology section explains how the research was conducted, followed by the results and discussion, which interpret the findings. The conclusion summarizes the key insights and suggests future research directions. Proper referencing using IEEE, APA, or another required format is crucial to maintain academic integrity.

Before submitting the paper, checking for plagiarism is a mandatory step. Using tools like Turnitin, Grammarly Premium, or Quetext helps ensure originality. Most journals accept a similarity index of less than 10-15%. If plagiarism is detected, paraphrasing and proper citation must be applied to maintain authenticity.

Once the paper is finalized, selecting a suitable journal or conference for publication is important. Submission guidelines must be followed carefully, and the paper may undergo peer review, where feedback from experts is received. Addressing the reviewers‚Äô comments and making necessary revisions increases the chances of acceptance.

Finally, presenting the research at conferences, workshops, or seminars helps in verifying its validity and receiving constructive feedback. Interacting with experts in the field enhances the quality of the research and opens opportunities for collaboration. Following this structured approach ensures a well-written and impactful research paper, ready for publication in a reputed journal or conference.
20/03/2025, 19:57 - +91 93458 37489: So guys if we wish to publish a paper we must correctly draft it in order to create a professional paper and all the citation must be done for making it as a whole after the citation correction and reviewing work the paper must be published either in open access (free access to anyone journal) or subscription journal (can be accessed by subscribed person)  and paper can be published either in any one to avoid Duplication of work so yes!!

26/03/2025, 18:37 - +91 90426 33450: This video is about learning how to deliver presentations confidently. 
Need to know
1)duration of presentation 
2)preparation of slides
3)1min per slide rule
4)preparing a delivery script
5)refer youtube videos 
6)prepare an agenda
We should mostly talk about the take away stuffs
Then should carry on with data
Key points in bullets is more useful for revising script
Practicing infront of mirror or use voice recorder and record it, hear it.
The main thing is to ignore nervousness and speak with confidence 
This is what i‚Äôve understood
26/03/2025, 18:45 - Madhuuuuuüíñ‚ú®: The video covers abt how to give a proper tech presentation 
Follow 1min/slide rule 
Collect info from research paper rather than copy pasting from blogs
Use key phrase as bullet points 
Stick to colours from the logo, use strandrad fonts j
Have a header/ footer
Go with very few diagrammatic data 
Focus on body posture while presenting
26/03/2025, 18:50 - +91 90426 33450: In this video, reading the research paper in a professional way is described
Getting credible information 
Quickly see author‚Äôs name
Beginners should start reading introduction first and mostly at the beginning
Then abstract and conclusion
Use ai tools for understanding technical terms that are unfamiliar with us
This ai tool answers our questions by simply uploading the paper.
If already read papers with samd field we need not read methodology , then results and discussion very carefully
Try to match it with data presented.
Highlight important parts to understand the summary of the paper
These are all the key points I‚Äôve understood in this video
26/03/2025, 19:03 - +91 90426 33450: ..This video summarises about plagiarism report generated and reading it
..plagiarism is copying others without giving credit
..we should use the information took by other articles within quotes and give credits to avoid plagiarism 
..second way is paraphrasing which is us using other‚Äôs ideas by using own words
..next way is to summarise other articles and telling its the summary of that particular article which is usually a gist of other ideas
..using ai tools cause accidental plagiarism to tackle it use trusted plagiarism checker
..paperpal can be used to check plagiarism check feature
..this feature checks thoroughly and error free which checks our report word by word for any known or unknown plagiarism usage.
This is what i have understood
26/03/2025, 20:41 - +91 79045 81859: Hey everyone,

Hope you all did well in your CAE exams! üî•
We had initially planned for an offline meetup today, but since most of you aren‚Äôt available and with exams coming up next week, we‚Äôve decided to conduct an online meeting instead.

This meeting will be with, all the team leads and staff coordinators of the club. The date and time will be shared soon, stay tuned‚ö°
15/04/2025, 22:22 - +91 79045 81859: Based on your performances and involvements, you will be given more opportunities within the club and new responsible positions,

or also maybe removed due to your inactiveness based on the feedback from your team leads, so, it's all in your hands! üôåüèº ‚ú®

It's been an incredible ride, and I'm so proud of what we've built. I'm confident you'll all keep the spirit alive and take the club to new heights. I'm bittersweet about leaving - I'll miss you all dearly, but I'm excited to see what the future holds. Take care, and stay awesome!!

As the President, my focus isn‚Äôt just on organizing events or encouraging paper writing or ensuring whether everyone completes their tasks...it's also about nurturing a positive and motivating environment for all of us. This is just the beginning, and there‚Äôs much more to come.

And all the best to everyone for your practicals üëçüèº

In NSS, I currently serve as an Event Coordinator. Over time, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to manage events, coordinate with people, and take on responsibilities both within and outside the college. I genuinely enjoy being in spaces where I can learn, grow, and support others in doing the same.

26/04/2025, 18:21 - +91 83000 61177: Hello everybody,

This is SUGIRTHA. P from the Paper Presentation Team!

First, I would like to sincerely thank Abul Hasan anna for his wonderful leadership. His guidance and hard work have set a strong foundation for our Paper Presentation Team. I truly appreciate the standards he had built, and I hope to continue that legacy while bringing in fresh ideas!!

I am passionate about research, learning, and presenting innovative ideas. I have had experience with paper presentations and have developed skills in organizing, communicating, and coordinating within teams. I believe that good leadership is not just about taking charge, but about bringing out the best in every member. If given the opportunity to lead, I will work hard to ensure our team stays motivated, well-prepared, and achieves excellence at every stage.

My vision is to not only participate in more events but to make sure our team leaves a mark wherever we go. I am committed to fostering a supportive, organized, and inspiring environment for all our members. 

Hope you would consider me for this role.

26/04/2025, 18:50 - +91 93906 78835: Hey everyone!
I'm Divyesh from the technical team. Over time, I‚Äôve participated in various events at our college and realized how much I enjoy being involved ‚Äî not just in the coding part, but also in the planning (Ashish NehraüòÖ).
Currently, I'm working with different coding languages, which honestly feels like assembling Avengers ‚Äî each language bringing a new power to help us organize and execute upcoming events even better!
I really enjoy learning from our seniors; it's like collecting cheat codes for real life.
Now, I feel confident that I can balance my technical work, planning responsibilities, and a little bit of chaos here and there.
That‚Äôs why I believe I‚Äôm ready to step up as the Technical Team Head ‚Äî to bring energy, ideas, and of course, some humor to the team while making sure everything runs smoothly!
